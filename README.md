# digital-holography-reconstruction
This repository contains a MATLAB script that applies digital signal processing to 2D digital holographic data to obtain 3D reconstructions of an object. It includes 2D Fourier filtering and angular spectrum wavefront propagation.

This script is part of a laboratory work. The objective was to capture holographic sensor data in a laboratory with two different angles between object and reference wavefront. This script was then used to obtain 3D reconstructions of the object, after which it was possible to observe differences between the two reconstructions.
